# I2C-Controller-design-using-the-MCSE-method
This project presents the design of a digital circuit based on the MCSE approach.
The circuit to be designed is an I2C controller whose role is to ensure the coupling of the microprocessor with external modules via an I2C(Inter-Integrated Circuit) communication protocol . 
The MSCE design approach was applied to come up with a solution that can be implemented in a Xilinx Zynq 7000 FPGA.
The simulation phase of the circuit timings allowed to validate the functional behavior of the circuit defined in the specifications.
The synthesis phase showed the logical resources necessary for the realization of the IP, which made it possible to check the coherence of the resources compared to the specification of the system.
